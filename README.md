Remove camouflaged links 
=======================

This **chrome-extension** removes the `onClick` Listeners from `<a href="">`-tags that will switch to another webpage. 

This *fixes* camouflaged links, that open a different webpage, than the statusbar tells you.

This annoying technique is used by *Facebook* and *Google* to detect what links you are most interested in.

The problem with that is not the track-URL, but the fact, that the statusbar should show you the exact link-target in all cases and all circumstances.
